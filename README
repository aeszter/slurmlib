slurmlib
========

An Ada frontend to Slurm

By Ansgar Esztermann <aeszter@mpibpc.mpg.de>

1. Goal
This library began its life as replacement for sgelib within qview 
(by the same author).
Whereas sgelib needed to call SGE binaries and extract information
from XML code, Slurm has a ready API.
This makes things easier and faster. 
Both slurmlib and the Slurm edition of qview are work in progress, and
they'll be quite incomplete for some time.

2. Requirements
The following libraries are needed:

  * Florist (POSIX API)

Of course, a working Slurm installation including the API library
(libslurm.so on Linux) is also necessary.

3. Shortcomings/Bugs
For an up-to-date list of bugs, see the issue tracker on GitHub.
Here, let it just be noted that slurmlib does not necessarily strive 
to provide the complete API -- its main goal is to provide the calls 
qview requires.
I'll be happy to take suggestions (or, better yet, pull requests) for
missing functionality, though.

For the time being, slurmlib evolves along with qview.
This has been hinted at by keeping the major version at 0.
